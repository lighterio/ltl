# ltl

ltl (pronounced "little") is a lightweight template language for JavaScript
which generates HTML. Its syntax is clean like Jade, and its performance
is amazing like [dot](https://github.com/olado/doT).

### Testing

*Performance testing* can be done by running `node perf`.
The output shows the average time in milliseconds it took to perform each of the operations.

*Unit testing* can be done by running `mocha`.

### Contributing

Setup is simple: just `git clone` and `npm install`, and you're ready to start.
